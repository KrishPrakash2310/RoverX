CAN uses differential signaling, where two wires (CAN_H and CAN_L) carry the signals. The differential voltage is the difference between the voltages on these two wires:

- **Dominant State**: CAN_H is higher than CAN_L.
- **Recessive State**: CAN_H and CAN_L are at the same voltage.

**Advantages of Differential Signaling:**

- **Common-Mode Noise Rejection**: Any noise induced on the bus affects both wires equally, and the differential receiver subtracts the noise from both signals, effectively canceling it out.
- **Reduced Emission**: The current flowing in opposite directions in the two wires cancels out the magnetic fields generated by the signals, reducing the EMI emitted by the bus.
